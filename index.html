        <p>Jordan, born under the sign Pisces, is an adventurous and caring gentleman. Besides being an avid gamer, he enjoyed flying, skydiving, and scuba diving. Passionate about helping people, his desire was to become a physical therapist. On September 2, 2018, he left our physical earth, after 20 short years of life, to become an overseer of his family. We will forever love his energy and passion.</p>

        <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/143918247@N04/page1" target="_blank" class="photos shadow">Here we share images of his life, family, and hobbies.</a>

        <p>The I'm A Star Foundation Leadership program was an integral foundation during his teen years leading up to college. He enjoyed being a S.T.A.R. student. His legacy will be helping sons of single mothers in Jacksonville, Florida pursue a technical degree or college education after high school through participating or application through the I’m A Star Foundation.</p>
